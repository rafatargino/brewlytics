A platform for analyzing BJCP beer evaluations using EDA, machine learning, and Streamlit to extract insights from judges' tasting notes and scores.

### What is BJCP
The BJCP (Beer Judge Certification Program) guidelines provide a comprehensive framework for evaluating and categorizing different beer styles, serving as a reference for judges in beer competitions. Craft beer competitions often utilize the BJCP guidelines as a standard for judging entries from homebrewers and artisanal brewers. https://www.bjcp.org/

### What is in brewlitcs
One of the challenges for those starting to taste beers is knowing if what they perceive in their evaluation matches what the beer actually presents. One of the best ways to improve your analysis process is to compare your results with those of others.

brewlitcs is a tool that helps judges in training to know if they are on the right track in three different ways. It provides a summary of the main keywords and descriptors from the BJCP. It summarizes several evaluations conducted for a beer, including one you participated in. And it presents your own evaluation for comparison.
