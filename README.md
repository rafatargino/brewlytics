## What is BJCP
The BJCP (Beer Judge Certification Program) guidelines provide a comprehensive framework for evaluating and categorizing different beer styles, serving as a reference for judges in beer competitions. Craft beer competitions often utilize the BJCP guidelines as a standard for judging entries from homebrewers and artisanal brewers.
